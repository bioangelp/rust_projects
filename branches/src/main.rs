    // Using too many else if expressions can clutter your code, so if you
    // have more than one, you might want to refactor your code.

    //When this program executes, it checks each if expression in turn and
    //executes the first body for which the condition holds true. Note that
    //even though 6 is divisible by 2, we donâ€™t see the output number is
    //divisible by 2, nor do we see the number is not divisible by 4,
    //3, or 2 text from the else block. The reason is that Rust will only
    //execute the block for the first true condition, and once it finds one, it
    //wonâ€™t even check the rest.

    let condition = true ;
    let numero = if condition { // es como si dijera si la condicion verdadera = 5
        5

        6

    println!("The number is {}", numero);

    // The number variable will be bound to a value based on the outcome of the if expression.
    // Remember that blocks of code evaluate to the last expression in them,
    // and numbers by themselves are also expressions. In this case, the value
    // of the whole if expression depends on which block of code executes.

    // both of the expresions have to evaluate to an integer, variables must have a single type
    // the compiler would be more complex and would make fewer guarantees
    // about the code if it had to keep track of multiple hypothetical types
    // for any variable.
